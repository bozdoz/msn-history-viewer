# msn-history-viewer

A React renderer for those old xml files

Remember how insane MSN was? Everything was custom and everything was changing: fonts, colors, backgrounds, profile images, even names!

There were even custom emoticons (I believe they were called that at the time)

Small chat windows, ads, late nights. Some beauty in the madness.
